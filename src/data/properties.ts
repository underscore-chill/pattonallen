    description: `This spacious 4-bedroom, 4.5-bath home is designed for students or families who want a quiet, high-quality place to live near UNC's campus. Every bedroom has a private bathroom. No sharing. No waiting. Great for graduate students, student athletes, or anyone who values privacy and convenience. Each bedroom has its own en-suite bathroom, so you won't be waiting in line or sharing your space.

There's also a huge sunroom that wraps around the back of the house. It's perfect as a gym, study area, or even a fifth bedroom. The open living and dining area connects to a modern kitchen with granite counters, plenty of cabinets, and all appliances included, plus an in-unit washer and dryer.

The location is ideal. Just a 6-10 minute drive to UNC, 15-20 minutes to Duke and Duke Hospital, and 20-25 minutes to RDU. The Chapel Hill Transit (free town bus) stop is right outside, and you can walk to Wegmans, cafes, and restaurants. Legion Road offers a quick back route to avoid 15-501 traffic.

Available July 1, 2025. Rent is $3,200 per month. The security deposit is one month's rent. Flexible lease terms from 12 months to 2 years. Tenants cover utilities and yard maintenance. Parking fits 3 to 4 cars in the driveway, with plenty of street parking too.

Perfect for a group of 4 roommates looking for comfort and independence. If you split rent evenly, it's about $800 each. One roommate might choose the oversized bedroom and chip in a bit more, but it's all flexible.

Furnishing options are available for an added cost if preferred. Just ask when you reach out to schedule a tour. This kind of home doesn't open up often in Chapel Hill.`,
