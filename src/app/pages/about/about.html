            Irene's experience in real estate sales on one of Asheville's top
            real estate teams, coupled with her success as a residential leasing
            agent in New York City made her move to Property Management in 2020
            a natural transition. She has a passion for real estate and supports
            her clients in their investments by prioritizing communication,
            providing exceptional customer service, and staying current on the
            changes in our fast-paced local market. As a member of the National
            Association of Residential Property Managers, Irene is always
            focused on expanding her knowledge and understanding in this field.
            She joined Patton Allen because she aligned deeply with their
            dedication to providing an extraordinary experience to both owners
            and tenants, and because of the company's commitment to supporting
            the local community.
